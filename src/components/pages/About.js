            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <br></br>

            <p align = 'left'>GLSEN exists to create safe, inclusive, and affirming schools for all K-12 students,
            regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity. GLSEN’s resources
            and programs continue to help students, schools, educators, systems, leaders, and communities 
            reduce victimization for LGBTQ+ youth and create a foundation for a safer, more equitable future.
            <br></br><br></br>
            GLSEN supports 44 local chapters in 29 states across the nation (and counting) working to advance equity
            in local schools and communities through professional development for educators, policy advocacy, youth engagement,
            and research initiatives. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            We empower students to affect change by supporting student-led efforts to positively impact 
            their own schools and local communities, via advocacy campaigns like the Day of Silence, GLSEN’s Changing the Game, and Solidarity Week. 
            GLSEN also supports thousands of registered GSAs nationwide (Gender Sexuality Alliances).
